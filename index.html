        <p>Our 6-jar package is by far our most popular.</p>
        <p>

          days.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the 6-jar package, you will secure the perfect supply of
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen to use daily without worrying about
          running out early.

          <span class="font-bold">our best deal</span> where you can get
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen for

              Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body, often called
              the "glue" that holds us together.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's a crucial building block for your bones, joints, muscles,
              tendons, and ligaments, as well as your skin, hair and nails.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of collagen as the framework that gives your body structure
              and support.

        <h2 class="content__title">The Problem With Collagen</h2>
        <p>
          As we age, our natural collagen production slows down, which can lead
          to wrinkles, joint pain, and weaker bones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long ago, the human diet consisted of collagen-rich foods – which
          helped offset our decline in collagen production.
        </p>
        <p>Today, however, our modern diets lack collagen.</p>
        <p>
          Therefore our bodies are losing collagen faster than we can replace
          it.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">
          Starting around the mid-twenties, our collagen levels can decline by
          1.5% per year.

          As a result, the skin's elasticity declines, wrinkles form and joints
          and bones weaken, causing nagging aches and pains.

        <p>
          This is especially true for women, as a dramatic reduction in collagen

              For the past decade, I’ve been providing natural solutions to

              Because most of my clients are over 60, their collagen levels are

            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, to compensate for the collagen loss, I recommend an

              To get the most out of collagen supplements, your body needs a

          The Longer You Take Collagen, The Better Your Joints, Bones, Hair,

        </h2>
        <p>
          You’ve seen firsthand how 2 scoops of NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen
          per day can provide incredible results.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you’ve seen the proven science and research behind the many
          benefits of collagen supplementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every month that you use collagen consistently, more benefits will
          unfold.
        </p>
        <p>So let me ask you this question…</p>
        <p class="font-bold">
          Are you willing to risk spending your so-called “golden years” trapped
          in a downward spiral of age-related decline?
        </p>
        <p>
          Joint pain tends to be the first indication that age-related wear and
          tear is catching up to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          These aches and pains can make it hard to perform simple, everyday
          tasks...
        </p>
        <p>Or engage in your favorite hobbies...</p>
        <p>
          Or worse, your years of independent living without assistance could
          start to slip away.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, many older adults have improved their joint and bone health
          by using the collagen loading technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          And reduce the aches and pains that come along with age-related wear
          and tear...
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">
          And get their confidence - and their
          <span class="font-italic">life</span> - back...
        </p>
        <p>
          After witnessing firsthand just how powerful collagen supplementation
          can be for people dealing with mobility issues, joint pain, and bone
          loss…
        </p>
        <p>
          I began putting all of my time and resources toward one goal and one
          goal only:
        </p>
        <p>
          To get collagen into as many hands as possible so that it can help
          people restore their bodies and their quality of life.

        </h2>
        <p>
          At this point, you may be wondering how you can try NativePath
          Grass-Fed Collagen yourself...
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with how much and how often do you need to take it for best
          results?
        </p>
        <p>At NativePath, our formula contains one single ingredient:</p>
        <p>Hydrolyzed collagen from grass-fed cattle.</p>
        <p>
          This is the richest source of type I and III collagen fibers – which
          make up over 90% of the collagen in our body.
        </p>
        <p>
          While other collagen brands use cheaper, multi-collagen types, we only
          use types I and III.
        </p>
        <p>
          This ensures you’re getting the most potent and pure collagen
          supplement on the market for healthy joints, bones, skin, hair, nails,
          and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of our products are as close to nature as possible, which is why
          you will never find any ultra-processed ingredients like artificial
          preservatives, colors, or chemical sweeteners.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there’s just one downside with NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen...
        </p>
        <p>
          Our meticulous manufacturing process and quality assurance can add
          weeks (sometimes months) to our operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means it can take a very long time to produce even a single jar
          of NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen.

          This is incredible news because I believe collagen should be a daily
          staple in our diet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason is simple: it’s the most important building block for
          healthy joints, bones, skin, hair, nails and more.
        </p>
        <p>Yet, our modern diet lacks collagen.</p>
        <p>
          That’s why I believe everyone should prioritize adding collagen back
          into their diet – especially people over 50 who are collagen
          deficient.

          As you know, our bodies have less collagen than they did in our

        <p>It's like as we age, our collagen tank starts running low.</p>
        <p>
          For people over 50, I suggest taking more collagen to fill up that
          tank.
        </p>

              It's like giving your body extra building blocks to strengthen

            </p>
            <p>
              Studies show that collagen needs to be taken every day for at
              least 2 to 12+ months to see the best results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people find it helpful to continue taking this larger amount

              mood and overall sense of well-being seemed to improve and I am no
              longer waking up in pain several times a night. More recently, I
              have noticed an increased range of motion in my shoulders and less
              cracking in my joints when I change positions. Yesterday I saw my
              chiropractor and told him about my experience. He said he could

        <h2 class="content__title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <p class="font-bold">Q.) How many jars should I order?</p>
        <p>
          Our best value and most popular quantity is our 6-jar package, which
          offers an unbeatable of just $21 per jar (retails for $37.99 per jar).
        </p>
        <p>
          At the normal retail price, this package would cost $227.94, but
          through this special page, you can take advantage of our limited-time
          up to 45% OFF discount and get 6 jars for a total of just $126.
        </p>
        <p>That’s a massive savings of over $101.</p>
        <p>
          You will also receive a FREE handheld frother and FREE shipping as
          part of our limited-time Fall Sale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, with a 6-jar supply, you will have plenty of collagen to take 2
          or more scoops per day without worrying about running out.
        </p>
        <p>
          By consistently taking NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen each day, you can
          help replenish your body’s collagen levels. Continued daily use will
          then help support your joints, bones, skin, hair, nails, and more.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">Q.) How many servings are in each jar?</p>
        <p>
          Each full-size jar of NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen contains 25
          servings.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">
          Q.) Where does NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen come from?
        </p>
        <p>
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen is sourced from pasture-raised cattle in
          South America.
        </p>
        <p>
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen is sourced from pasture-raised cattle in
          South America.
        </p>
        <p>
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen is manufactured in the USA and contains
          zero ultra-processed ingredients. That means no artificial
          preservatives, flavors, dyes, sugar, seed oils, gluten, or GMOs.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">
          Q.) How many times per day should I take collagen?
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on feedback from our customers, 10 to 20 grams (or more) of
          collagen per day can provide the greatest age-defying joint, bone,
          skin, hair, and nail benefits. We recommend taking at least 20 grams
          (2 scoops) daily for maximum results.
        </p>
        <p>
          This might be especially helpful for people over the age of 50, whose
          collagen levels may have already declined by a staggering 50% (or
          more).
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking multiple scoops per day may help restore your collagen deficit
          so that full results can be achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen has no taste or odor, adding
          multiple scoops to your diet has never been easier. Simply add
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen to your coffee or tea, smoothie, juice,
          or unsweetened almond milk, or even add it to your yogurt, oatmeal,
          soup, or baked goods.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">Q.) What is the best way to use this product?</p>
        <p>
          The easiest way to use NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen is to mix a
          serving into 8-12 oz of any hot or cold beverage and gently stir.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">
          Q.) How long do I have to use this product before I see results?
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of our customers notice results as early as their first week with
          NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, more profound results are reported with regular prolonged
          use. This is why we recommend stocking up with the 6-jar package so
          that you can experience the full benefits of long-term collagen use
          without the risk of running out.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">Q.) What is collagen, anyway?</p>
        <p>
          Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body, accounting for
          about a third of its protein composition. It's one of the major
          building blocks of joints, bones, skin, hair, nails, muscles, tendons,
          and ligaments. Collagen is also found in many other body parts,
          including our gut lining, blood vessels, corneas, and teeth.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">Q.) Why should I add collagen to my diet?</p>
        <p>
          While our bodies are fully equipped to produce collagen naturally,
          once we hit our twenties, it begins to decline by 1-1.5% per year.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, one study looked at type I collagen in the skin of old
          individuals versus young folks and found that collagen synthesis was
          decreased by 68% in old skin versus young skin*.
        </p>
        <img class="content__img" src="./img/protocollagen.png" alt="Image" />
        <p>
          If you’ve ever wondered why our skin begins to sag and wrinkle as we
          get older – it’s likely that low collagen levels are behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is because as you age, your body produces less collagen. The
          effects, such as achy joints, bone loss, wrinkled skin, and brittle
          nails, may become noticeable after several years.
        </p>
        <img class="content__img" src="./img/collagen-score.png" alt="Image" />
        <p>
          Fortunately, research has shown that by adding a high-quality collagen
          supplement to your diet, you can provide your joints, bones, hair,
          skin, and nails with the support required to promote vibrant health at
          any age.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold">
          Q.) How will this product be shipped to me and how quickly?
        </p>
        <p>You can expect to receive your order within 7-10 business days.</p>
        <p class="font-bold">
          Q.) What are the ingredients in NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen?
        </p>
        <p>
          The only ingredient in NativePath Grass-Fed Collagen is hydrolyzed
          bovine collagen.
